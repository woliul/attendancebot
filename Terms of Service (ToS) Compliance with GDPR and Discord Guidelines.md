### Terms of Service (ToS) Compliance with GDPR and Discord Guidelines

To align your **ToS** with GDPR and Discord’s guidelines, consider the following:

1. **User Responsibilities for Data Compliance**:
   Emphasize that users must comply with all applicable laws and have appropriate permissions before recording attendance or other data that may be shared with the bot.

2. **User Rights and Bot Limitations**:
   Reaffirm that users can request data deletion and specify that Attendance Bot’s services may be limited in some cases to respect these privacy requests.

3. **Disclaimer of Liability for External Data Sharing**:
   Include a clause stating that while Attendance Bot limits its own data sharing, Discord may also have access to certain information as per its own privacy policies. Clarify that any personal data shared with third parties (e.g., Discord) is subject to those parties’ terms and policies, not just Attendance Bot’s.

### Additional Considerations for Compliance

- **Explicit Consent for Data Processing**: GDPR requires that you obtain clear consent, especially if you’re collecting data on sensitive topics or storing information long-term. For Discord bots, this might mean having a setup command or agreement message that specifies the bot’s functions and data use.
  
- **Data Access Requests**: For GDPR, users have the right to request information on how their data is used and stored. Implementing a command (e.g., `/request_data`) allows users to initiate a data request directly through the bot.

- **Data Processing in Discord’s Environment**: Since Discord itself collects data from users, ensure users know that your bot only processes data necessary for attendance and that additional data handling may be subject to Discord’s own privacy and data policies.
